        <h1>User Documentation</h1>
        <p>Your user documentation should be constructed as HTML documents, and include
screen shots of your program. Images should be in one of the formats: jpeg, gif,
png. You should check that your HTML files are rendered correctly on a Unix
based machine as well as when using a Windows based browser to ensure they do
not contain malformed HTML.(A very common mistake made by Windows users
is to use the '\' character as a directory separator when specifying file paths. The
HTML standard requires the use of the '/' character instead.) You can check your
HTML at http://validator.w3.org. Passing validation at this site is is recommended
but not required.</p>
