        <h1>User Documentation</h1>
        
        <p>This site contains the user documentation for the Software Engineering Processes and Tools Assignment 1. Use the menu to navigate through the different components of the documentation</p>
        
        <p>Team Members:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Daniel Bugeja</li>
            <li>Jayden Joyce</li>
            <li>Todd Ryan</li>
            <li>Luke Young</li>
        </ol>
            
        <p>Your user documentation should be constructed as HTML documents, and include
screen shots of your program. Images should be in one of the formats: jpeg, gif,
png. You should check that your HTML files are rendered correctly on a Unix
based machine as well as when using a Windows based browser to ensure they do
not contain malformed HTML.(A very common mistake made by Windows users
is to use the '\' character as a directory separator when specifying file paths. The
HTML standard requires the use of the '/' character instead.) You can check your
HTML at http://validator.w3.org. Passing validation at this site is is recommended
but not required.</p>
